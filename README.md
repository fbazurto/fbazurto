### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fatima Bazurto. I am a computer science student at CSUCI. I am currently working on completing a machine learning foundations certificate from eCornell. 

I am interested in learning more about machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools to create data-driven solutions in the fields of medicine, environmental science, and business.
