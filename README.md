#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fatima Bazurto. I am a computer science student at CSUCI. I am currently working on completing a machine learning foundations certificate from eCornell. I am especially interested in learning more about machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools. I am also interested in the health sciences, having worked in a clinical setting as a Certified Nurse Assistant.
#### I am excited at the prospect of using my background in patient care to create data-driven solutions in the healthcare field.
